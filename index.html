    <h1>General Records Schedule (GRS) 6.1</h1>
    <h2>Email Managed under a Capstone Approach</h2>
    <br/><br/>
    <p>The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) issued General Records Schedule (GRS) <a href="http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/grs/grs-6.1-review-package.pdf">6.1 Email Managed under a Capstone Approach</a> to provide Federal agencies legal authority to disposition email under the Capstone Approach.  This approach was issued and is outlined in <a href="http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/bulletins/2013/2013-02.html">Bulletin 2013-02</a>.</p>
    <p>The GRS 6.1 schedule applies only to Federal agencies that implement a Capstone approach as described in this GRS.  If an agency is implementing a Capstone disposition approach different from what is provided in this GRS, the agency must submit a records schedule.</p>
    <p>This site contains data sets for active approved verification forms, NA-1005s, submitted by Federal agencies requesting use of these disposition authorities in GRS 6.1.</p>
    <p>Data from this form includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Name of the agency to which this form applies;</li>
      <li>Applicable record group number;</li>
      <li>Selection of which GRS 6.1 items the agency is proposing to use;</li>
      <li>Information on implementation scope and legacy email; and</li>
      <li>List of Capstone Officials by category (position titles)*.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>*Definitions of what is included within a category is described on the Verification for Implementing GRS 6.1: Email managed Under a Capstone Approach NA-1005 form.</p>
    <p>For questions on the GRS 6.1 and/or form NA-1005, please contact NARA’s GRS Team at <a href="mailto:GRS_Team@nara.gov">GRS_Team@nara.gov</a>.</p>
